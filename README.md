The data set in this project is very small so I don't do any advance cleanup except to remove some null values.

About the dataset:

this dataset contains bike sales data for December 2021.
What I have shown in the analysis

I have tried to show :

# What age group buys the most mountain bikes
# What is the percentage of male and female buyer 
# Profits and order quantities among countries 
# State wise order quantities 
# Most selling bike models and the unite price of them
# Unite cost of each bike models 

This is my first project. I am open for your suggestion. It will help me to upgrade. 
This dataset is downloaded from kaggle.com
