The data set in this project is very small so I don't do any advance cleanup except to remove some null values.

### About the dataset:

this dataset contains bike sales data for December 2021.
What I have shown in the analysis

### I have tried to show :

1. What age group buys the most mountain bikes
2. What is the percentage of male and female buyer 
3. Profits and order quantities among countries 
4. State wise order quantities 
5. Most selling bike models and the unite price of them
6. Unite cost of each bike models 

This is my first project. I am open for your suggestion. It will help me to upgrade.
